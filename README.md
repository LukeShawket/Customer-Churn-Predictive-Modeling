# Customer Churn Predictive Modeling
## Overview
This project aims to predict customer churn using Logistic Regression and SMOTE to address class imbalance. The model provides insights into factors influencing churn and helps businesses proactively retain customers.    
## Features & Key Components
* Data cleaning: Handling missing values, changing data types with SQL.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing trends with Seaborn & Matplotlib.  
* Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.      
* Predictive Modeling: Implementing Logistic Regression and tuning decision thresholds.    
* Oversampling (SMOTE): Balancing data to improve recall.
* Model Evaluation: Using precision, recall, F1-score to assess performance.
